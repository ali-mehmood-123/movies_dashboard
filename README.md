# movies_dashboard
This project is about analysing audience movie preferences and based on their preference creating a dashboard for public to look up for movies which they want to watch from.
A detailed documentation about the project is shared in the repository and also a PPT summarizing the analysis of data and insights is shared here to get a clear understanding of how we reached the conclusions and deployed the dashboard.
